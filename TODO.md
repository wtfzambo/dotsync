# Todo

[] - In taskfile, customize build command to work on windows (basically add .exe and for date function use `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"`)
[] - Add warning that windows 10-11 needs admin / developer mode on to create symlinks. (where? In docs? In program? both?)

Final output desired:
- Windows can build dotsync locally by itself
- Windows detects most common paths for Google Drive and Dropbox

In readme, MAKE NOTE ABOUT ENABLING FILE STREAMING! (for gdrive, idk about dropbox, need to test)

## Notes

Apparently iCloud drive exists in windows too (need to test / maybe keep for later)
